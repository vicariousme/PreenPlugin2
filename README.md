#Preen#

Preen is a skin manager for [Plex Home Theater and Plex Media Center](http://www.plexapp.com/desktop/). It has been available as a [Max OS X application](http://www.anomiesoftware.com/Anomie_Software/Preen.html) since 2010.

PreenPlugin exists to bring Preen as a Plugin for Plex Media Server. It is open-source Python code so that anyone can contribute. It can be modified to work for Windows. It can be maintained when I don't have time to maintain it.

##WARNING: Terrible Python code ahead.##
This is my first Python code, so if you hate, please contribute to making it better.

Git is currently required.

Desired Features:
	Windows compatibility.
	Automatically update skins.
	Remove git requirement.
	Show images from the skins when they are browsed.
	Ability to change the skin from within the plugin.
	Some soft of feedback about how far a git download has progressed.
	
Known Issues:
	Not compatible with Alaska/Laika skin.
	git pull won't work because of the skin encoding thing
	we're naming folders improperly
	Blur shows up twice (because we look at the skin names and the name Blur exists twice)

Changelog:
 - Nov 30, 2013: The plugin can download PHT skins with Git on the Mac.
 - Nov 30, 2013: The plugin now separates Laika skins from PHT skins.
 - Initial Release: The plugin can list skins from the skins list.
 - Initial Release: The plugin can download/update existing skins with git on the Mac.
